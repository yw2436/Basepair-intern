# Basepair-intern
This repository is used to record my work at Basepair, NYC, during summer 2018. My work there is mainly on building DNA methylation analysing pipelines for BS-seq data.
The exact date is between June, 4th and Aug, 10th.

Job includes:
  1. Investigate, i.e. read reviews about BS-seq or WGBS(whole genome bisulfite sequencing), and select approriate pipelines to process BS-seq data. Pipelines selected are Bismark and methylpy
  2. Simulate DNA reads using Dnemulator, which is a tool that can simulate sequencing reads considering sequencing errors, SNPs, methylation levels, etc.
  3. To be continued.
