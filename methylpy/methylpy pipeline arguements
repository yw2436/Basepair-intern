                        list of library IDs (in the same order as the files
                        list) indiciating which libraries each set of fastq
                        files belong to. If you use a glob, you only need to
                        indicate the library ID for those fastqs once (i.e.,
                        the length of files and libraries should be the same)
                        (default: ['libA'])
  --path-to-output PATH_TO_OUTPUT
                        Path to a directory where you would like the output to
                        be stored. The default is the same directory as the

  --pbat PBAT           Boolean indicating whether to process data in PBAT
                        (Post-Bisulfite Adaptor Tagging) mode, in which reads

                        wish to include in output file. Recommend value 1 for
                        NOMe-seq processing since the upstream base is
                        required to tell apart cytosine at GC context.
                        (default: 0)
  --num-downstream-bases NUM_DOWNSTREAM_BASES
                        Number of base(s) downstream of each cytosine that you
                        wish to include in output file. Recommend value to be
                        at least 1 to separate cytosines at different sequence
                        context. (default: 2)

                        output file that contains the methylation state of
                        each cytosine. If set to be false, only alignment file
                        (in BAM format) will be generated. (default: True)
  --generate-mpileup-file GENERATE_MPILEUP_FILE
                        Boolean indicating whether to generate intermediate
                        mpileup file to save space. However, skipping mpileup
                        step may cause problem due to the nature of python.
                        Not skipping this step is recommended. (default: True)
  --compress-output COMPRESS_OUTPUT
                        Boolean indicating whether to compress (by gzip) the
                        final output (allc file(s)). (default: True)

                        Path to bowtie/bowtie2 installation (default: )
  --aligner ALIGNER     Aligner to use. Currently, methylpy supports bowtie,
                        bowtie2 and minimap2. (default: bowtie2)
  --aligner-options ALIGNER_OPTIONS [ALIGNER_OPTIONS ...]
                        list of strings indicating options you would like
                        passed to bowtie (e.g., "-k 1 -l 2") (default: None)
  --merge-by-max-mapq MERGE_BY_MAX_MAPQ
                        Boolean indicates whether to merge alignment results
                        from two converted genomes by MAPQ score. Be default,
                        we only keep reads that are mapped to only one of the
                        two converted genomes. If this option is set to True,
                        for a read that could be mapped to both converted
                        genomes, the alignment that achieves larger MAPQ score
                        will be kept. (default: False)
  --remove-clonal REMOVE_CLONAL
                        Boolean indicates whether to remove clonal reads or
                        not (default: False)

                        sequence of an adapter that was ligated to the 3' end.
                        The adapter itself and anything that follows is
                        trimmed. (default: AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTG)

                        Boolean indicates whether to remove in the final
                        output the "chr" prefix in the chromosome name
                        (default: True)
  --add-snp-info ADD_SNP_INFO
                        Boolean indicates whether to add extra two columns in
                        the output (allc) file regarding the genotype
                        information of each site. The first (second) column
                        contain the number of basecalls that support the
                        reference gentype (variant) for nucleotides in the
                        sequence context. (default: False)
  --unmethylated-control UNMETHYLATED_CONTROL
                        name of the chromosome/region that you want to use to
                        estimate the non-conversion rate of your sample, or
                        the non-conversion rate you would like to use.
                        Consequently, control is either a string, or a
                        decimal. If control is a string then it should be in
                        the following format: "chrom:start-end". If you would
                        like to specify an entire chromosome simply use
                        "chrom:" (default: None)
  --binom-test BINOM_TEST
                        Indicates that you would like to perform a binomial
                        test on each cytosine to delineate cytosines that are
                        significantly methylated than noise due to the failure
                        of bisulfite conversion. (default: False)
  --sig-cutoff SIG_CUTOFF
                        float indicating the adjusted p-value cutoff you wish
                        to use for determining whether or not a site is
                        methylated (default: 0.01)
  --min-mapq MIN_MAPQ   Minimum MAPQ for reads to be included. (default: 30)
  --min-cov MIN_COV     Integer indicating the minimum number of reads for a
                        site to be tested. (default: 0)
  --max-adapter-removal MAX_ADAPTER_REMOVAL
                        Indicates the maximum number of times to try to remove
                        adapters. Useful when an adapter gets appended
                        multiple times. (default: None)
  --overlap-length OVERLAP_LENGTH
                        Minimum overlap length. If the overlap between the
                        read and the adapter is shorter than LENGTH, the read
                        is not modified. This reduces the no. of bases trimmed
                        purely due to short random adapter matches. (default:
                        None)
  --zero-cap ZERO_CAP   Flag that causes negative quality values to be set to
                        zero (workaround to avoid segmentation faults in BWA)
                        (default: None)
  --error-rate ERROR_RATE
                        maximum allowed error rate (no. of errors divided by
                        the length of the matching region) (default: None)
  --min-qual-score MIN_QUAL_SCORE
                        allows you to trim low-quality ends from reads before
                        adapter removal. The algorithm is the same as the one
                        used by BWA (Subtract CUTOFF from all qualities;
                        compute partial sums from all indices to the end of
                        the sequence; cut sequence at the index at which the
                        sum is minimal). (default: 10)
  --min-read-len MIN_READ_LEN
                        indicates the minimum length a read must be to be
                        kept. Reads that are too short even before adapter
                        removal are also discarded. In colorspace, an initial
                        primer is not counted. (default: 30)
  --min-base-quality MIN_BASE_QUALITY
                        Integer indicating the minimum PHRED quality score for
                        a base to be included in the mpileup file (and
                        subsequently to be considered for methylation
                        calling). (default: 1)
  --keep-temp-files KEEP_TEMP_FILES
                        Boolean indicating that you would like to keep the
                        intermediate files generated by this function. This
                        can be useful for debugging, but in general should be
                        left False. (default: False)
